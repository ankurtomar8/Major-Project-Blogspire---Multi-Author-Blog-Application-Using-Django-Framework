1,"The Battle of Marineford was a momentous war that took place on the island of Marineford between the Whitebeard Pirates and their allies, led by the Emperor, Edward ""Whitebeard"" Newgate, and the entirety of Marine Headquarters' forces, including the Seven Warlords of the Sea, over the execution of the Whitebeard Pirates' second division commander.

The clash resulted in the Whitebeard Pirates' failure to save Ace[1] and the death of their captain, Whitebeard, along with many other comrades.[2] Despite the conflict being an overwhelming victory for the Marines, the aftermath of the battle showed an increase of pirate activities worldwide due to Whitebeard's final words that confirmed the existence of One Piece. The conflict also led to multiple major power shifts in the world.","2020-11-30 17:45:24",1,"Marine Ford"

The Straw Hats finally reach the desert kingdom of Alabasta and begin their race across the land to reach Alubarna before a massive war breaks out between the kingdom's royal guards and the rebels. However, the true perpetrator of the war, Mr. 0 and the remaining Baroque Works officer agents stand in the way of reaching their goal.

The kingdom of Alabasta is on Sandy Island, the fourth island the Straw Hat Pirates encounter in the Grand Line. It is a large desert kingdom ruled by king Nefertari Cobra.","2020-12-01 11:55:24.031710",1,"Alabasta Arc"

10,"<p><strong>When&nbsp;Guido van Rossum&nbsp;developed Python in the 1990s as his side project, nobody has thought it would be the most popular programming language one day. Considering all well-recognized rankings and industry trends, I put Python as the number one programming language overall.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Python has not seen a meteoric rise in popularity like Java or C/C++. Also, Python is not a disruptive programming language. But from the very beginning,&nbsp;Python has focused on developer experience&nbsp;and tried to lower the barrier to programming so that school kids can also write production-grade code.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 2008, Python went through a massive overhaul and improvement with the cost of introducing significant breaking changes by introducing Python 3.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today, Python is omnipresent and used in many areas of software development, with no sign of slowing down.</strong></p>","2020-12-01 18:55:40.025617",1,Python

Brendan Eich&nbsp;</strong>had developed the initial prototype in only ten days, and the rest is history<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Software developers often ridiculed JavaScript in its early days because of its poor language design and lack of features.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the years, JavaScript has evolved into a multi-paradigm, high-level, dynamic programming language. The first significant breakthrough of JavaScript came in 2009 when&nbsp;<strong>Ryan Dahl</strong>&nbsp;has released cross-platform JavaScript runtime&nbsp;<strong>Node.js</strong>&nbsp;and enabled JavaScript to run on Server Side.</em></p>

<p><em>The other enormous breakthrough of JavaScript came around 2010 when Google has released a JavaScript based&nbsp;<strong>Web development framework AngularJS</strong>.</em></p>

12,"<p>Java is one of the most disruptive programming languages to date. Back in the &rsquo;90s, business applications were mainly developed using C++, which was quite complicated and platform dependent.&nbsp;<strong>James Gosling</strong>&nbsp;and his team in Sun lowered the barrier to develop business applications by offering a much simpler, object-oriented, interpreted programming language that also supports Multi-threading programming.</p>

<p>Java has achieved Platform independence by developing Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which abstracted the low-level Operating System from developers and gave the first &ldquo;<strong>Write Once, Run anywhere</strong>&rdquo; programming language. Also, JVM offered generation garbage collection, which manages the Object life cycle.</p>

<p>In recent years, Java has lost some of its markets to highly developer-friendly modern languages and the rise of other languages, especially Python, JavaScript. Also, JVM is not quite Cloud friendly because of its bulky size. Oracle has recently introduced hefty licensing fees for JDK, which will dent Java&rsquo;s popularity further.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Java is working on its shortcomings and trying to make Java fit for Cloud via the GraalVM initiative. Also, in OpenJDK, there is a free alternative to the proprietary Oracle JDK.</p>

<p><strong>C++ also offers full control over hardware but with the cost of accidental complexity</strong>&nbsp;and does not provide language-level support for memory safety and concurrency safety.
